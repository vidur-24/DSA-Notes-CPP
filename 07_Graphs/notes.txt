# GRAPHS
-> Graphs = Vertices + Edges
-> Types = Directed and Undirected, Cyclic and Acyclic
-> Path and Degree of Graph
-> Imp : DAG = Directed Acyclic Graph

# REPRESENTATION
-> Two ways to represent Graphs: 
1. Matrix (SC = O(V*V))
2. List (SC = O(2E))

# TRAVERSAL
-> Two traversal techniques :
1. DFS
2. BFS

# SHORTEST PATHS
-> Three shortest path algos:
1. Dijkstra (single source, greedy)
2. Bellman (single source, dp)
3. Floyd Warshall (multi source, dp)

-> Spanning Tree: a tree with n nodes and n-1 edges, and each nodes are reachable from one another
-> MST : ST with minimun cost
-> Two algos to find MST: 
1. Prims
2. Krushkal
