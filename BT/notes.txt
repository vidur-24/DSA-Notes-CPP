BT:
-> 2 child trees
-> Types of BT:
   1. Full BT : every node has 0 or 2 children
   2. Complete BT : all levels are fully filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right
   3. Perfect BT : all leaves are at the same level
   4. Balanced BT : height of tree at max is log(n)
   5. Degenerate (or pathological or skewed) : each parent node has only one child



BT representation in CPP:
```
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    Node(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};
```


Traversal of BT:
1. DFS:
    - Preorder (NLR)
    - Inorder (LNR)
    - Postorder (LRN)
2. BFS: 
    - Level order traversal
