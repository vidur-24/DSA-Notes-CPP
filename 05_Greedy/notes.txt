GREEDY APPROACH:
-> local optimal solution at each sub-problem will eventually lead to global solution
-> Ex: Prims, Krushkal, Dijkstra
-> Ex: Activity Selection (N meetings in one room), Fractional Knapsack, Job Sequencing with Deadline, Min Coins Change, Huffman Encoding
-> Ex: SJF(cpu scheduling), LRU(page replacement)
-> Note: Greedy doesnt always work, Ex: 0/1 Knapsack
-> to improve TC of algo use DP instead of Greedy


General Greedy Algorithm Steps:
1. Sort data (if needed) based on a heuristic.
2. Initialize the result.
3. Iterate over data and pick the best possible option at each step (locally optimal).
4. Update the result.
5. Return the final answer.


Tips to Identify Greedy Problems:
- Problem asks for maximum/minimum (e.g., time, cost, profit).
- You can make a choice at each step.
- Choices are independent (future steps don't depend on past decisions).
- The problem hints that local optimum = global optimum.
