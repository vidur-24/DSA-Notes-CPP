int 13 = ( 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1101 ) -> stored as 32 bit in memory
int -13 = ( 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 0011 ) -> stored as 2's complement of 13

- bit manipulation techniques can also be applied to long long, the only diff is that it stores the number as 64 bit



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
int x = 36 = 100100
1's complement = 011011
2's complement = 011100 -> from right to left same as original but after 1st 1 it's complemented



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operators for BIT MANIPULATION:
- and = x&y
- or = x|y

- xor = x^y -> number of 1s : odd = 1 , even = 0
- xnor = ~(x^y) -> number of 1s : odd = 0 , even = 1

- left shift = x<<y -> bits are shifted to left and 0s are added to right = x * 2^y
for each left shift by 1, number is *2
- right shift = x>>y -> bits are shifted to right and 0s are added to left = x / 2^y
for each right shift by 1, number is /2

- not = ~x 
step1 : flip the bits
step2 : if number becomes -ve, take 2's complement
        if not then stop


NOTE: (2^31 - 1 << 1) = (1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111) = overflow condition
